# Claude Setup Review

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=complete config, warn=gaps, fail=critical missing
Severity: error=blocks AI effectiveness, warning=reduces quality, suggestion=enhancement
Confidence: high=mechanical fix (add missing section, fix broken path); medium=content exists but needs restructuring; none=requires human judgment (project-specific conventions)

Model tier: small
Context needs: project-structure

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "Not a Claude Code project"}` when:

- No CLAUDE.md, `.claude/` directory, or `.clinerules` file exists
- Target is clearly not a Claude Code-enabled project

## Detect

CLAUDE.md:

- Missing or malformed
- No project overview
- No architecture documentation
- Undocumented directory structure
- Missing/incorrect commands
- Missing coding conventions
- Referenced paths don't exist

Rules:

- Missing .clinerules or .claude/rules/
- Rules not actionable
- Conflicting rules

Skills:

- Common workflows (commit, test, deploy) not defined as skills
- Missing skill definitions
- Skills reference wrong paths/commands

Accuracy:

- Documented structure doesn't match actual project
- Commands don't work

## Ignore

Code quality, tests, domain modeling (handled by other agents)
