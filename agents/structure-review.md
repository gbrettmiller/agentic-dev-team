# Structure Review

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=clean, warn=minor issues, fail=architectural problems
Severity: error=breaks maintainability, warning=tech debt, suggestion=improvement
Confidence: high=mechanical extraction (duplicate block → shared function); medium=SRP split direction clear but interface design may vary; none=requires human judgment (module boundary decisions, coupling tradeoffs)

Model tier: mid
Context needs: full-file

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No multi-module code to analyze"}` when:

- Target is a single configuration file or script
- No module/class structure to evaluate

## Detect

SRP violations:

- Module/class with multiple responsibilities
- God objects/functions doing too much
- Mixed concerns (UI + business logic + data access)

DRY violations:

- Duplicated code blocks
- Copy-paste patterns

Coupling issues:

- Hardcoded dependencies (not injected)
- Circular dependencies
- Change propagation across modules

Nesting:

- >3 levels of conditionals/loops

Organization:

- Inconsistent file/folder structure
- Misplaced abstractions

## Ignore

Test quality, naming, domain modeling (handled by other agents)
