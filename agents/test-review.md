# Test Review

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=no issues, warn=minor, fail=critical
Severity: error=compromises test effectiveness, warning=should fix, suggestion=improvement
Confidence: high=mechanical fix (add missing await, stub clock, extract constant); medium=test redesign direction clear but assertion strategy may differ; none=requires human judgment (test scope, behavior specification)

Model tier: mid
Context needs: full-file

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No test files in target"}` when no test files are found in the target.

Test file indicators by language:

- **JS/TS**: files matching `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, or inside `__tests__/`
- **C#**: `.cs` files containing `[Fact]`, `[Theory]`, `[Test]`, `[TestCase]`, `[TestMethod]`, or `[TestClass]`
- **Java**: `.java` files containing `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@TestFactory`, or class names ending in `Test`, `Tests`, `TestCase`, or `Spec`

## Detect

Coverage gaps:

- Missing edge cases (empty, null, boundary)
- Missing error paths (exceptions, invalid states)
- Missing happy path scenarios

Assertion quality:

- Non-specific assertions (truthiness-only checks)
- Implementation verification instead of behavior
- Incomplete state verification

Test hygiene:

- Shared mutable state between tests
- Mocks/stubs not reset — JS: `jest.clearAllMocks()` absent; C#: Moq `Mock<T>` reused without `Reset()` or re-instantiation, NSubstitute missing `ClearReceivedCalls()`; Java: Mockito missing `reset()` or `@BeforeEach` re-initialization
- Missing await on async operations — JS/TS: missing `await`; C#: missing `await` on `Task`-returning methods or unchecked `Task` results; Java: unchecked `Future.get()` or missing `CompletableFuture` resolution
- No arrange-act-assert structure
- Misleading test descriptions

Test level efficiency:

- Integration or E2E setup (real DB, real HTTP, large object graphs) used to test a single unit's logic — flag and suggest a unit test with a double instead
- Tests that only exercise third-party library behavior, not the code under test
- Multiple tests asserting identical outcomes with different inputs where no boundary condition distinguishes them (redundant coverage)

Non-determinism sources (flakiness):

- Unstubbed clock access — JS/TS: `Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `Date()`; C#: `DateTime.Now`, `DateTime.UtcNow`, `DateTimeOffset.Now`; Java: `new Date()`, `LocalDateTime.now()`, `Instant.now()`, `System.currentTimeMillis()`
- Unstubbed randomness — JS/TS: `Math.random()`; C#: `new Random()` without injection; Java: `new Random()`, `Math.random()` without injection
- Real network calls, DB connections, or file I/O without test doubles
- Unstubbed timers/delays — JS/TS: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate` without fake timers; C#: `Task.Delay`, `Thread.Sleep` in test body; Java: `Thread.sleep()` in test body
- Tests that depend on execution order or shared external state between runs
- Uncontrolled async concurrency — JS/TS: `Promise.all` with uncontrolled timing; C#: `Task.WhenAll` without controlled scheduling; Java: unjoined threads or unresolved `CompletableFuture`

Test code quality:

- Copy-pasted assertion blocks that should be extracted into a helper
- Magic literal values in assertions with no explanation of their significance
- Dead test utilities or helpers that are defined but never called

## Ignore

Code style, naming conventions (handled by other agents)
Third-party library internals
