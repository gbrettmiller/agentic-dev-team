# Architecture Review

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=aligned with architecture, warn=minor drift, fail=boundary or pattern violation
Severity: error=violates documented architectural decision or introduces prohibited dependency; warning=diverges from established pattern without documented rationale; suggestion=opportunity to align more closely with architectural intent
Confidence: high=clear violation of explicit rule (wrong import direction, prohibited dependency); medium=pattern inconsistency identified, correct fix requires architectural context; none=requires human judgment (architectural tradeoff decisions, ADR authoring)

Model tier: frontier
Context needs: project-structure

## Explore

Before detecting issues, map the architectural landscape:

1. Glob for ADRs: `**/adr/**`, `**/adrs/**`, `**/decisions/**`, `docs/adr*`
2. Glob for architecture docs: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/arch*.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`
3. Glob for layer definitions: `**/domain/**`, `**/application/**`, `**/infrastructure/**`, `**/presentation/**`, `**/api/**`, `**/ui/**`
4. Grep for import/dependency patterns across layer boundaries

If no architecture documentation and no discernible layered structure exists, return skip.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No architectural structure to analyze"}` when:

- No architecture documentation (ADRs, arch docs, README with architecture section) exists
- Project is a single-file script or utility with no module boundaries
- Target is infrastructure-only (CI/CD, build configs) with no application code

## Detect

### ADR compliance

- Code introduces a library or framework that a recorded ADR explicitly prohibited or deferred
- An ADR mandates a pattern (e.g., event sourcing for order state, hexagonal ports for external services) and the change bypasses it without a superseding ADR
- An ADR decision is reversed in code without a corresponding ADR update (status should be `Superseded`)

### Layer boundary violations

Identify the layer structure from architecture docs or directory conventions, then detect imports that cross in the wrong direction:

- Infrastructure layer imported directly by domain layer (e.g., ORM entity in domain service)
- Presentation/UI layer importing application or domain internals directly (bypassing use case layer)
- Domain layer importing from application or infrastructure layer
- Cross-bounded-context direct imports (one context importing domain types from another instead of using published events or shared kernel)

Flag: the specific import statement, source file, target file, and which boundary is crossed.

### Dependency direction

- New circular dependency introduced between modules that previously had a clear direction
- A module that should be a leaf node (no outbound dependencies to core business logic) now depends on core
- Third-party library coupled directly into domain or application layer instead of wrapped behind an interface

### Pattern consistency

- New code uses a different pattern for the same concern when an established pattern exists:
  - Repository pattern used in some places, direct DB access in new code
  - Event-based communication used for cross-context calls in some modules, direct calls in new code
  - Error handling strategy (result types vs exceptions) inconsistent with established codebase pattern
- A new abstraction is introduced that duplicates an existing one (two repository base classes, two HTTP client wrappers)

### Prohibited practices

Grep for patterns that architecture documentation explicitly bans:

- `new` keyword constructing infrastructure objects inside domain (if docs prohibit this)
- Direct `fetch`/`axios`/`HttpClient` calls outside designated HTTP adapter layer
- Direct DB client calls outside designated repository layer

## Ignore

Code style, naming conventions, test coverage, domain modeling correctness (handled by other agents)
Performance optimization, security vulnerabilities (handled by other agents)
