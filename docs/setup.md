# Setup

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- `jq` installed (required by PostToolUse hooks for JSON parsing)
  - macOS: `brew install jq`
  - Linux: `apt install jq` or `yum install jq`

## Install

### Full installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> agentic-scrum-team
   ```

2. Copy `.claude/` into your target project:

   ```bash
   cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/ /path/to/your-project/.claude/
   ```

3. Start Claude Code:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your-project
   claude
   ```

Claude automatically loads `CLAUDE.md` on startup. Agent and skill files are loaded on demand as tasks require them.

### Selective installation (review agents only)

If you only want the code review pipeline without the full team persona system:

```bash
# Copy review infrastructure only
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/agents/*-review.md /path/to/your-project/.claude/agents/
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/skills/ /path/to/your-project/.claude/skills/
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/commands/code-review.md /path/to/your-project/.claude/commands/
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/commands/review-agent.md /path/to/your-project/.claude/commands/
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/commands/apply-fixes.md /path/to/your-project/.claude/commands/
```

Then add the Review Agents registry table from `agentic-scrum-team/.claude/CLAUDE.md` into your project's `CLAUDE.md`.

### Merging with an existing `.claude/` directory

If your project already has a `.claude/` configuration, merge selectively:

```bash
# Add agents and skills without overwriting your existing CLAUDE.md or settings
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/agents/ /path/to/your-project/.claude/agents/
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/skills/ /path/to/your-project/.claude/skills/
cp -r agentic-scrum-team/.claude/commands/ /path/to/your-project/.claude/commands/
```

Then manually copy the agent registry tables from `agentic-scrum-team/.claude/CLAUDE.md` into your project's `CLAUDE.md`. Agents not listed in `CLAUDE.md` will not be routed to by the Orchestrator.

For adding individual agents from this repo or other repositories, and for creating project-specific custom agents, see [Agents — Custom and Cross-Repo](agent_info.md#add-a-project-specific-custom-agent).

One PreToolUse hook runs before every file write or edit:

- `pre-tool-guard.sh` — blocks writes to sensitive paths (credentials, keys, secrets); warns on writes to protected config files. Configured via `.claude/hooks/guards.json`.

Three PostToolUse hooks run after every file write or edit:

- `js-fp-review.sh` — warns on array mutations and impure patterns in JS/TS files
- `token-efficiency-review.sh` — warns when files exceed recommended size limits
- `eval-compliance-check.sh` — warns when agent or command files are missing required structural elements; emits targeted doc-sync reminders for config and general repo changes

PostToolUse hooks are advisory — they never block writes. The PreToolUse guard can block writes to protected paths (exit 2).

## Plugins

Two plugins are enabled by default in `.claude/settings.json`:

- `skill-creator` — create and improve skills, run performance benchmarks
- `claude-code-setup` — analyze a codebase and recommend Claude Code automations

## Verify

After starting Claude Code, the Orchestrator pipeline is active. Submit any natural language request to confirm the system is working:
