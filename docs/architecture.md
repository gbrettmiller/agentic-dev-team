```

The Orchestrator receives every request, classifies it by type and complexity, selects agents, assigns models, and coordinates delivery. During Phase 3 (Implement), review agents check coding agent output at each discrete unit-of-work checkpoint. Findings feed back as structured corrections (max 2 cycles before human escalation). After each task, the learning loop captures metrics and evaluates whether configuration updates are needed.

## Model Routing

The Orchestrator is the **authoritative source for model selection**. Individual agent `model:` frontmatter is a fallback for direct invocation only. When the orchestrator spawns an agent via the Agent tool, it passes model explicitly from the routing table.

| Model | Assigned to |
| --- | --- |
| `haiku` | naming-review, complexity-review, claude-setup-review, token-efficiency-review, performance-review |
| `sonnet` | test-review, structure-review, js-fp-review, concurrency-review, a11y-review, svelte-review, orchestrator, qa-engineer, tech-writer, software-engineer (default) |
| `opus` | security-review, domain-review, architect, software-engineer (architectural changes) |

Full routing table: `agents/orchestrator.md` → Model Routing Table section.

## Inline Review Loop

During Phase 3, after each discrete unit of work:

1. Orchestrator selects targeted review agents based on what changed (JS/TS → js-fp-review + complexity-review; API surface → security-review; etc.)
2. Agents run in parallel as sub-agents with orchestrator-assigned models
3. `fail` findings → packaged as correction context → sent to coding agent
4. Coding agent revises only targeted code
5. Failed agents re-run; if still `fail` after 2 iterations → escalate to human
6. `warn` findings → logged in phase output, continue
7. Final gate: `/code-review --changed` before commit

## Context Management

The Orchestrator manages context utilization using two operational skills.

### Loading Protocol

[Context Loading Protocol](../.claude/skills/context-loading-protocol.md) controls what gets loaded and when:

1. **Classify** the task (simple, standard, multi-agent, complex)
2. **Select** the minimum set of agents and skills required
3. **Load in phases**: primary agent first, supporting agents as their phase begins
4. **Unload** previous-phase agents via summarization before loading next-phase agents

### Summarization

[Context Summarization](../.claude/skills/context-summarization.md) controls when to compress:

| Utilization | Action |
| --- | --- |
| < 40% | Normal operation |
| 40-50% | Prepare for summarization |
| 50-60% | Summarize older conversation turns |
| 60-75% | Aggressive summarization |
| 75%+ | Write summary to `memory/`, start new conversation |

Utilization is measured via the `usage` field in API responses. Summaries follow a structured template and are stored in `memory/` for cross-session continuity.

### Token Budgets

| Component | ~Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| CLAUDE.md (always loaded) | ~1,400 |
| Single team agent | 290-560 |
| Single skill | 420-1,020 |
| All team agents (no skills) | ~3,590 |
| Review agents | ~2,800 (sub-agents, not loaded in parent context) |
| Full load (all team agents + all skills) | ~14,200 |

A typical task loads 1 agent + 1-2 skills: roughly 1,000-2,000 tokens of configuration overhead. Review agents run as isolated sub-agents — their context burden does not accumulate in the parent.

## Quality Assurance

Validation happens in this sequence during Phase 3:

| Order | Layer | Who | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Self-validation | Active agent | Before delivering any unit of work |
| 2 | Inline review checkpoint | Targeted review agents | After each discrete unit of work |
| 3 | Review feedback correction | Coding agent | Up to 2 correction cycles per checkpoint |
| 4 | Final code review | `/code-review --changed` | Before committing; runs full agent suite |
| 5 | Documentation review | Tech-writer | After code review passes; verifies docs reflect current behavior |
| 6 | Peer validation | QA agent | After implementation, before phase delivery |
| 7 | Human gate | User | At each phase transition (Research, Plan, Implement) |
| 8 | Post-hoc monitoring | Orchestrator | During learning loop after task completion |

Every agent applies the [Accuracy Validation](../.claude/skills/accuracy-validation.md) self-check before output. This includes factual accuracy verification, instruction fidelity, internal consistency, and confidence scoring.

Quality gates by task type:

| Task Type | Required Gates |
| --- | --- |
| Code implementation | Self-validation + QA review |
| Architecture design | Self-validation + human approval |
| Documentation | Self-validation + terminology check |
| Bug fix | Self-validation + regression test |
| Data analysis | Self-validation + statistical validation |

## Human Oversight

Agents operate autonomously within boundaries. The [Human Oversight Protocol](../.claude/skills/human-oversight-protocol.md) defines three levels of human involvement:

| Level | When | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Autonomous** | Routine work within scope | Writing a unit test |
| **Notify** | Significant but within scope | Choosing between two valid patterns |
| **Approve** | High-impact or outside scope | Database schema change, production deploy |

Intervention commands (`override`, `pause`, `stop`) give humans immediate control when needed.

## Governance

[Governance & Compliance](../.claude/skills/governance-compliance.md) defines audit and ethics requirements:

- All task completions logged to `metrics/` (JSONL format)
- All configuration changes logged to `metrics/config-changelog.jsonl`
- Conversation summaries stored in `memory/` for cross-session continuity
- Sensitive data (credentials, PII) never stored in metrics or memory files
- All agent decisions must be explainable on request

## Feedback Loop

[Feedback & Learning](../.claude/skills/feedback-learning.md) enables continuous improvement:

1. User provides feedback via keywords (`amend`, `learn`, `remember`, `forget`)
2. Changes are previewed, applied, and logged with full audit trail
3. The Orchestrator monitors for recurring patterns (3+ occurrences)
4. System-initiated changes are proposed to the user with rationale

## Multi-LLM Routing

Tasks can be routed to different LLMs based on complexity and cost:

| Criteria | Claude | Gemini |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task complexity | Complex tasks | Simple, high-volume |
| Cost sensitivity | Premium | Cost-optimized |
| Context requirements | Large context | Standard context |
| Precision requirements | Critical components | Standard components |

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Efficiency gains | 10-15% over manual workflows |
| Structured data accuracy | > 95% |
| Hallucination rate | < 5% |
| Conversation-long accuracy | > 95% |
| First-pass acceptance | > 80% |
